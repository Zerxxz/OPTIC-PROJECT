# OPTIC

> **O**n-chain **P**redictable **T**ransparent **I**ntelligence for **C**ommerce

A verifiable, auditable AI quant agent for DeepBook. Strategy hash, decision log, and
PnL are all **on-chain objects**. Anyone can replay every decision, audit the risk
gates, and see exactly why an order was placed — without trusting the operator.

Built for **Sui Overflow 2026**.

## Why OPTIC

Most "AI agent" demos are **black boxes**: a single key, a single prompt, an opaque
trade history. OPTIC is different:

1. **Strategy commitment** — The owner uploads a strategy to Walrus and the
   `core::Agent` Move object stores the `blob_id` + `sha256(strategy_code)` on-chain.
   The Move contract refuses to act on any strategy that doesn't match the
   committed hash.
2. **Capability-gated actions** — Three roles (`quant`, `risk`, `executor`) each
   get a `core::AgentCap`. Orders can only be placed when the right combination
   of caps sign the PTB.
3. **Multi-agent decision log** — A `QuantAgent` proposes trades, a `RiskAgent`
   has veto + can open a Predict hedge, an `ExecutorAgent` does defence-in-depth
   re-checks. The winning decision — with full `reasoning` text — is logged to
   Walrus and anchored to an on-chain `walrus_adapter::AuditEntry`.
4. **Predict tail-hedge** — When realized vol crosses the threshold, the risk
   agent opens a `NO` position on DeepBook Predict with strike = 5% OTM and
   expiry = 24h. Sized at 1% of treasury.
5. **Strategy NFT via Kiosk** — Strategies are first-class objects that can be
   transferred, licensed, or forked through the standard Sui Kiosk marketplace.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Run the orchestrator tests (no Sui required)
cd orchestrator
npx tsx --test src/__tests__/orchestrator.test.ts
# → 12/12 pass

# 2. Watch a 14-cycle demo
cd ..
npx tsx scripts/demo-cycle.mts --n 14

# 3. Serve the Walrus Site locally
cd frontend/site
python3 -m http.server 8089
# → open http://localhost:8089/
```

### Deploy to Sui testnet

```bash
# Publish the Move package
./scripts/publish.sh --network testnet

# Initialize the agent
./scripts/init-agent.sh --name agent-alpha --strategy mean-reversion

# Inspect the new package + agent ids
cat orchestrator/.env
```
